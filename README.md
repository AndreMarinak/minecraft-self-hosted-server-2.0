# Minecraft Self Hosted
This repository contains scripts and configuration for self hosting a Minecraft server on a linux machine. You just need some type of machine/pc to be able to follow this tutorial. It will use linux for the OS.

## Knowing the basics
- Knowing basic terminal commands like ls, mkdir, cd, nano, cat will make this much easier


## Getting Started
Choose the guide that matches your situation:

- I already have a Linux machine or server setup
  → README-startfromlinux.md

- I do NOT have a Linux machine yet, I just have an old pc/machine
  → README-startfromzero.md




## How players can connect to your machine (aka connect to the server)
There are two different easy options for making your server available to others:
- Using tailscale (smaller number of players)
    - Pros: Very easy setup, easy control
    - Cons: When further away distance wise, ping can get higher, requires all users to install tailsacle
- using playit.gg
    - Pros: You get a public link people can join without any change to their device
    - Cons: Limited to one free public link, ping can get higher with distance
